# photoblog
A photoblog-like webpage. VERY BASIC and minimalist. Example: http://travler.herokuapp.com/ 

# Note:
Repo and code currently only exist for my personal use. 
If someone else wants to use it feel free to fork, but to be fair, unless you want to edit the code and 
make it more robust/secure, you might as well use wordpress or something. 

# Requires
- Rust (nightly) for rocket web framework 
- postgres database for post storage

# Caveats 
Not unit tested or documented.
